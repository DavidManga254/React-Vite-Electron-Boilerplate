## ðŸ“‚ Directory structure

Familiar React application structure, just with `electron` folder on the top:  
*Files in this folder will be separated from your React application and built into `dist-electron`*  

```tree
â”œâ”€â”€ electron                                 Electron-related code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main                                 Main-process source code
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ preload                              Preload-scripts source code
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ release                                  Generated after production build, contains executables
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ {version}
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ {os}-{os_arch}                   Contains unpacked application executable
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ {app_name}_{version}.{ext}       Installer for the application
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ src                                      Renderer source code, your React application
```
